**HTML5 Canvas - PDF Area Annotation Example**

This is a basic no-library / no-framework approach to drawing shapes upon an HTML5 Canvas tag.

It's purpose is to demonstrate how one could apply area annotations upon a rendered pdf document or image in a lower level canvas element.

**To Build**

The only library in use is WebPack, to enable bundling of the assets into a single easy to use js file.

1. npm install (this will install WebPack)
2. webpack --config webpack.config.js
3. Serve the contents of the /dist folder

All the source can be found under the /src folder
